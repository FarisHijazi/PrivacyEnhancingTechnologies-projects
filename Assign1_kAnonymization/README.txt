To run the code, please see the jupyter notebook: assignment1_k_anonymization.ipynb, it requires installing the packages: pandas, numpy.

You can see the report in "documents/assignment1_k_anonymization - Jupyter Notebook.pdf" (or .html which allows scrolling through the tables).

Note that the report already contains the jupyter notebook's output and there is no need to re-run it, however feel free to do so.
