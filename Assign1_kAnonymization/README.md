# assignment1_k_anonymization

See the [notebook file here](assignment1_k_anonymization.ipynb).

## About

This project implements [KAnonymization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) using the [Mondrian](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~mxk055100/courses/privacy08f_files/MultiDim.pdf) algorithm.

We also perform a linkage attack by matching two datasets and searching for common entries.

### Objectives

The objectives of this assignment is the following:

1. Conduct various type of attacks on a public dataset
2. Implement a k-anonymization algorithm, in particular, Mondrian mutidimensional
3. Analyze the tradeoff between privacy and utility, and
4. Understand the difference between k-anonymization, l-diversity, and
t-closeness

## Run

To run the code, please see the jupyter notebook: assignment1_k_anonymization.ipynb, it requires installing the packages: pandas, numpy.

You can see the report in "documents/assignment1_k_anonymization - Jupyter Notebook.pdf" (or .html which allows scrolling through the tables).

Note that the report already contains the jupyter notebook's output and there is no need to re-run it, however feel free to do so.
